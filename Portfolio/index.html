<h2>A Little Bit More About Me</h2> 

<p>I come from a non traditional programming background, meaning everything I know I have taught myself or I learned it from free coding programs. I have tried my hand at various programming languages such as Python, SQL, Java, but at the end of the day I find most joy in building websites. More specifically designing them with HTML & CSS. I hope you enjoy my projects as much as I have enjoyed making every single one of them! And if you like any particular design or have a project in mind that you think I could be of help, feel free to contact me at anytime.</p>
